This folder can be imported as a Java project in Eclipse.

Some source folders may show errors but as long as the folder 'javelin' doesn't you should be able to hack, compile and play the game.

The source code has been developed under Java 6. Bringing it to Java 8 would be the next step in the project's development.

On Linux, the package.sh script will let you create a javelin.zip file intended for releasing the game. You will need to export a JAR under Eclipse with the name javelin.jar to this folder first - again you might experience some errors/warnings but everything should work fine as long as the 'javelin' folder compiles.
