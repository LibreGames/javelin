Each town has a certain area around it called a district. This space is used for building supporting structures around a town, which are listed below. Moving inside the district is usually safe. The actual size of a town's district is determined by that town's population and other factors and you can see it by hovering the mouse over the town in question.

Once a structure starts building, it will be placed in the district's area as a construction site but won't be useful until enough work is put into it, which you can follow on the town management screen. If a building is located inside the districts of two towns at once, it will usually benefit both of them where applicable.

Note that some of the labor options described below are not actual structures (like Grow and Produce settler) and hence have no "construction site" associated with them.

Build traveller's lodge: a place to rest and recover for a small fee, can be upgraded to hotel (requires village) and hospital (requires town).
Growth: grows the city population by 1, resulting in higher labor throughput and possibly increasing the district size, up to "city" size.
Trait: adding a trait to a town will open up new project options, as seen below.

EXPANSIVE DISTRICTS

Build outpost: outposts greatly increase the vision range of your city.
Build highway: same as build road but with greater benefits and greater labor time, requires a town or city. 
Build road: creates a roas between two towns, improving travel time and safety along the way.
Produce settler: reduces city population by 1 but adds a settler unit to a squad inside the district which is able to build a new town elsewhere in the world map.

INDUSTRIOUS DISTRICTS

Build mine: a mine allows you to mine gold and can be upgraded to automatically mine rubies.
