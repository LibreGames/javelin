CONDITIONS (1/2)

Burrowed: burrowed creatures receive +4 on armor class (not cumulative with 
defense, see below). A burrowed creature can only move or resurface and it is 
never considered engaged in battle.

Cover: to determine whether your target has cover from your ranged attack, 
choose a corner of your square. If any line from this corner to any corner of 
the targetâ€™s square passes through a square or border that blocks line of 
effect or provides cover, or through a square occupied by a creature, the 
target has cover (+4 to AC). 

Charge: charging is a special full-round action that allows you to move up to 
twice your speed and attack. You must move at least 10 feet (2 squares) and may
move up to double your speed directly toward the designated opponent. You must 
have a clear path toward the opponent. After moving, you may make a single 
melee attack. You get a +2 bonus on the attack roll and take a -2 penalty to 
your AC until the start of your next turn.

Defending: +4 bonus to armor class (not cumulative with burrow).

Exhausted: moves at half speed and takes a -6 penalty to strength and dexterity.

Fatigued: can neither run nor charge and takes a -2 penalty to strength and 
dexterity.

Feigned: a creature who suffered a feint loses any dexterity bonus to it's 
armor class.
